# Automating EDR Compliance with Tines
NIST updated the [Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework).  They introduced the Govern function as the glue to the other functions.  Governance means creating a framework taliored to the organization's critical mission. To ensure an organization can operate in a cyber or physical incident, infosec policies and standards are created to reduce cyber risk or business risk.  Compliance is the means to ensure adherence to the infosec standards and policies.

To assit with IT departments with the EDR compliance, I created a web form where an IT admin or infosec analyst can upload a csv with hostnames to check to see if they are present in the CrowdStrike Falcon platform.
